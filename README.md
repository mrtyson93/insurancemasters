# Part 2

- **Note**: All User Stories are expressed as user stories if you click into the details of a PBI. The titles of the PBIs are shorter on the backlog for brevities sake.

- **Forecasted Points**: 100 Points Per Sprint
- **Rationale**: There are 270 total points of User Stories planned in our backlog which are planned to complete throughout the semester. There are three sprints so we divided by three and rounded up to an even 100. This will allow us to plan all of the user stories throughout the next three sprints.

- **Stories pulled into backlog**: Our backlog is ordered in terms of what needs to get done first, we, the developers, pulled the maximum stories into our sprint from the top of the backlog that did not exceed our forecasted points.

- All stories are less than half of our current forecast.
- User stories were decomposed into tasks, in our Miro board, red items are tasks, and blue items are user stories as outlined by the key.

- **Daily Scrums**: Scrums were completed in our slack channel when not able to meet on weekends due to time constraints of people being located around the world. Documentation of each days minutes are located in the minutes folder of our github repo. These minutes include what everyone did, what they plan to do, and what the impediments were, if any.[Minutes](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/tree/main/ProjectManagement/minutes) Here is a link directly to one days documentation of a scrum meeting: [Nov 11](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/blob/main/ProjectManagement/minutes/11%20Nov%20-%20daily%20scrum.docx)

- **Impediment Removal Plan**: Swarm the impediment as a team to come up with a solution or workaround to unblock the impediment.

- **Sprint board update and Burndown Updates**: Screenshots of burndown updates are above.

- **Pair programming evidence**: ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint1/pairprogram1.png?raw=true) ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint1/pairprogram2.png?raw=true)

- **Tests**: The tests are built using selenium and are in the testing folder at [Testing](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/tree/main/ProjectManagement/testing). A screeenshot of the 10 successful unit tests are below. ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint1/tests.png?raw=true)

- **Sprint Review**: Part 1 held on 11/14 without stakeholder. Decision made: Database creation task is required for the retrieval of the information using the email. It is not required for form page. Moving to next sprint PBI for revisiting quotation. Part 2 held on 11/15 with the stakeholder.

- **Sprint Retro Actions:**
  - Populate latin text with real text
  - Update User Stories to be more user story accurate
  - Take out unused functionality
  - KT with selenium user testing so others can better know the technology and help with it. (This is in the backlog)
  - Come up with definition of done (We completed this in the retro and moved it to completed because we thought it was important to do quickly.)

-**Other**: We came up with a Definition of Done after the retro so that we know when we can close a user Story. Definition is:

- All related backlog items to user story are done
- Product owner approval
- Acceptance criteria met for each story
- New unit tests passed
- No bugs introduced, all prior tests still pass

# Part 3

- **Note**: All User Stories are expressed as user stories if you click into the details of a PBI. The titles of the PBIs are shorter on the backlog for brevities sake.

- **Forecasted Points**: 100 Points Per Sprint
- **Rationale**: Last Sprint we completed 100 points with not much room to spare so we used that as our expected velocity again. Although, we did end up pulling 20 extra points from the backlog this sprint for a total completed points of 120. It appears our velocity has gone up as the process has smoothed out.
- **Stories pulled into backlog**: Our backlog is ordered in terms of what needs to get done first, we, the developers, pulled the maximum stories into our sprint from the top of the backlog that did not exceed our forecasted points.

- All stories are less than half of our current forecast. (Max of 40)
- User stories were decomposed into tasks, in our Miro board, red items are tasks, and blue items are user stories as outlined by the key.

- **Kanban board link**: [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lnCeYTY=/?invite_link_id=692868496345) The board is split into Sprint 1 and Sprint 2 which are clearly labeled.

- **Burndown chart**: Also on the same Miro Board and split out by sprint: [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lnCeYTY=/?invite_link_id=692868496345) Miro doesnt keep the formatting of the burndown chart line so progressive screenshots of it below. We also started the sprint with expected points of 100, but we went over that to 120, which is why the points go into the negative. ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/burndown2.png?raw=true) ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/burndown3.png?raw=true) ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/burndown4.png?raw=true)

- **Daily Scrums**: Scrums were completed in our slack channel when not able to meet on weekends due to time constraints of people being located around the world. Documentation of each days minutes are located in the minutes folder of our github repo. These minutes include what everyone did, what they plan to do, and what the impediments were, if any. [Minutes](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/tree/main/ProjectManagement/minutes) Here is a link directly to one days documentation of a scrum meeting: [Nov 21](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/blob/main/ProjectManagement/minutes/21%20Nov%20-%20daily%20scrum%20-%20sprint%202.docx)

- **Impediment Removal Plan**: Swarm the impediment as a team to come up with a solution or workaround to unblock the impediment. For example, as documented in our [Nov 19th](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/blob/main/ProjectManagement/minutes/19%20Nov%20-%20daily%20scrum%20-%20sprint%202.docx) minutes, there was an impediment to complete mob programming because the team is distributed around the world, this would have not allowed us to complete our mob programming requirement. The solution was to piggyback it to our consistent weekend meeting agenda, because that is the known time that we have available. As another example, there was an impediment that did not allow us to run tests after an application was deployed in our heroku pipeline, which would have not allowed us to finish our CD pipeline. Our initial plan was to switch the pipeline tech stack to Amazon Codestar but then Bing and Mitchell swarmed that issue and found a custom buildpack that allowed us to run custom shell scripts which allowed us to run tests post deploy in our pipeline.

- **Stakeholder attending Sprint Review Proof**: ![Alt text](TBD)
- **Continuous Integration**:
  We used herokus pipeline feature to implement our CI pipeline. The first thing it does is after code is pushed to main is run the unit tests as outlined in the [app.json](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/blob/main/app.json) file. If those tests fail, the pipeline does not proceed, if they all pass, the pipeline proceeds. Screenshots of the tests in the pipeline are below. ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/ci1.png?raw=true). You can also see from the screenshot below that we have hooked up our github repository to the pipeline so that whenever main is pushed to, the pipeline is run. We as a team, only develop from the main branch.

- **Continuous Delivery**:
  We also use herokus pipeline feature to implement the CD portion of our pipeline. After the tests are successfully run, the pipeline deploys to our qa environment, then our production environment, then runs a simple to test that the website is reachable and is returning expected content. If any of these steps fail, the pipeline stops and does not proceed to further steps.
  Here is a screenshot of our pipeline steps ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/cd1.png?raw=true) Here is a screenshot of the logs of the project being built and deployed. ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/cd2.png?raw=true). And finally, here is a screenshot from the logs of testing the website is up and running after the app has been deployed. ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/cd3.png?raw=true)

- **Sprint Retro Actions:**
  - TBD
