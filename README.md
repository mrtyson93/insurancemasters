  - Motivation/Needs
    - Motivation and needs for insurance is that he wants Simple, ran small biz, he had a corporate but too much overhead, so he changed to sole proprietorship. He likes it that there are no accountants, no contract signature, just invoice. He did not have insurance until someone did not pay, regulations about having insurance required him to have insurance. Wants the insurance on the same day, so not worry about loss of customers, have it and show the certificate (proof) of insurance immediately (digital or paper). Does not anticipate a lot of changes to his policy. He has other insurance such as payroll company associated when employee (unemployment insurance), part timers (subcontractors, and perform services on your behalf)

    - Automatic pay monthly
    - Servicing Aspects - Urgent real time chat or voice for technical questions. If not urgent by email, calling insurance company to talk to somebody
    - If tomorrow he needs larger coverage, he wants that quick and just as fast
  - Technology and access mechanisms that he regularly uses – desktop, mobile, operating system, browsers, et al

    - Desktop and laptop mostly, Apple OS. Safari browser.

  - Other
    - Revenues <$25m/yr

- No Impediments
- Business value defined
- Acceptante Criteria defined
- Story Points Estimated

## Whole-team relative-size estimating activity

Method used was [T-Shirt-Sizes](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/agile-story-point-estimation-techniques-t-shirt-sizing/). This activity was only done by the developers.

Used points 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 as the different size options.

# Part 2

- **Note**: All User Stories are expressed as user stories if you click into the details of a PBI. The titles of the PBIs are shorter on the backlog for brevities sake.

- **Forecasted Points**: 100 Points Per Sprint
- **Rationale**: There are 270 total points of User Stories planned in our backlog which are planned to complete throughout the semester. There are three sprints so we divided by three and rounded up to an even 100. This will allow us to plan all of the user stories throughout the next three sprints.

- **Stories pulled into backlog**: Our backlog is ordered in terms of what needs to get done first, we, the developers, pulled the maximum stories into our sprint from the top of the backlog that did not exceed our forecasted points.

- All stories are less than half of our current forecast.
- User stories were decomposed into tasks, in our Miro board, red items are tasks, and blue items are user stories as outlined by the key.

- **Kanban board link**: [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lnCeYTY=/?invite_link_id=692868496345)

- **Burndown chart**: Also on the same Miro Board: [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lnCeYTY=/?invite_link_id=692868496345) Miro doesnt keep the formatting of the burndown chart line so here are progressive screenshots of it ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint1/kanban1.png?raw=true) ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint1/kanban2.png?raw=true) ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint1/kanban3.png?raw=true)

- **Daily Scrums**: Scrums were completed in our slack channel when not able to meet on weekends due to time constraints of people being located around the world. Documentation of each days minutes are located in the minutes folder of our github repo. These minutes include what everyone did, what they plan to do, and what the impediments were, if any.[Minutes](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/tree/main/ProjectManagement/minutes) Here is a link directly to one days documentation of a scrum meeting: [Nov 11](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/blob/main/ProjectManagement/minutes/11%20Nov%20-%20daily%20scrum.docx)

- **Impediment Removal Plan**: Swarm the impediment as a team to come up with a solution or workaround to unblock the impediment.

- **Sprint board update and Burndown Updates**: Screenshots of burndown updates are above. Screenshots of board below. ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint1/backlog1.png?raw=true) ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint1/backlog2.png?raw=true) ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint1/backlog3.png?raw=true)

- **Pair programming evidence**: ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint1/pairprogram1.png?raw=true) ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint1/pairprogram2.png?raw=true)

- **Tests**: The tests are built using selenium and are in the testing folder at [Testing](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/tree/main/ProjectManagement/testing). A screeenshot of the 10 successful unit tests are below. ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint1/tests.png?raw=true)

- **Sprint Review**: Part 1 held on 11/14 without stakeholder. Decision made: Database creation task is required for the retrieval of the information using the email. It is not required for form page. Moving to next sprint PBI for revisiting quotation. Part 2 held on 11/15 with the stakeholder.

- **Stakeholder attending Sprint Review Proof**: ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint1/stakeholderproof.png?raw=true)
- **Sprint Retro Actions:**
  - Populate latin text with real text
  - Update User Stories to be more user story accurate
  - Take out unused functionality
  - KT with selenium user testing so others can better know the technology and help with it. (This is in the backlog)
  - Come up with definition of done (We completed this in the retro and moved it to completed because we thought it was important to do quickly.)

-**Other**: We came up with a Definition of Done after the retro so that we know when we can close a user Story. Definition is:

- All related backlog items to user story are done
- Product owner approval
- Acceptance criteria met for each story
- New unit tests passed
- No bugs introduced, all prior tests still pass

# Part 3

- **Note**: All User Stories are expressed as user stories if you click into the details of a PBI. The titles of the PBIs are shorter on the backlog for brevities sake.

- **Forecasted Points**: 100 Points Per Sprint
- **Rationale**: Last Sprint we completed 100 points with not much room to spare so we used that as our expected velocity again. Although, we did end up pulling 20 extra points from the backlog this sprint for a total completed points of 120. It appears our velocity has gone up as the process has smoothed out.
- **Stories pulled into backlog**: Our backlog is ordered in terms of what needs to get done first, we, the developers, pulled the maximum stories into our sprint from the top of the backlog that did not exceed our forecasted points.

- All stories are less than half of our current forecast. (Max of 40)
- User stories were decomposed into tasks, in our Miro board, red items are tasks, and blue items are user stories as outlined by the key.

- **Kanban board link**: [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lnCeYTY=/?invite_link_id=692868496345) The board is split into Sprint 1 and Sprint 2 which are clearly labeled.

- **Burndown chart**: Also on the same Miro Board and split out by sprint: [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lnCeYTY=/?invite_link_id=692868496345) Miro doesnt keep the formatting of the burndown chart line so progressive screenshots of it below. We also started the sprint with expected points of 100, but we went over that to 120, which is why the points go into the negative. ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/burndown2.png?raw=true) ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/burndown3.png?raw=true) ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/burndown4.png?raw=true)

- **Daily Scrums**: Scrums were completed in our slack channel when not able to meet on weekends due to time constraints of people being located around the world. Documentation of each days minutes are located in the minutes folder of our github repo. These minutes include what everyone did, what they plan to do, and what the impediments were, if any. [Minutes](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/tree/main/ProjectManagement/minutes) Here is a link directly to one days documentation of a scrum meeting: [Nov 21](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/blob/main/ProjectManagement/minutes/21%20Nov%20-%20daily%20scrum%20-%20sprint%202.docx)

- **Impediment Removal Plan**: Swarm the impediment as a team to come up with a solution or workaround to unblock the impediment. For example, as documented in our [Nov 19th](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/blob/main/ProjectManagement/minutes/19%20Nov%20-%20daily%20scrum%20-%20sprint%202.docx) minutes, there was an impediment to complete mob programming because the team is distributed around the world, this would have not allowed us to complete our mob programming requirement. The solution was to piggyback it to our consistent weekend meeting agenda, because that is the known time that we have available. As another example, there was an impediment that did not allow us to run tests after an application was deployed in our heroku pipeline, which would have not allowed us to finish our CD pipeline. Our initial plan was to switch the pipeline tech stack to Amazon Codestar but then Bing and Mitchell swarmed that issue and found a custom buildpack that allowed us to run custom shell scripts which allowed us to run tests post deploy in our pipeline.

- **Sprint board update and Burndown Updates**: Screenshots of burndown updates are above. Screenshots of board below, individuals who completed the tasks are assigned to the tasks on the kanban board ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/backlog1.png?raw=true) ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/backlog2.png?raw=true) ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/backlog3.png?raw=true)

- **Tests**: The unit tests are in the python_logic\test_quote.py file. [File here](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/blob/main/python_logic/test_quote.py). A screeenshot of 28 successful unit tests are below. Our final submissions has 26 unit tests ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/tests.png?raw=true)

- **Sprint Review**: Part 1 held on 11/28 without stakeholder. Part 2 held on 11/29 with the stakeholder. From our sprint review we added three new user stories based off of feedback from our stakeholder that are outlined in the screenshot below

- **Stakeholder attending Sprint Review Proof**:
  - **Richard is our stakeholder**![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/sprintreviewstakeholder.png?raw=true)
- **Continuous Integration**:
  We are using herokus pipeline feature to implement our CI pipeline. ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/cd1.png?raw=true) We only have one branch that we use which is the main branch. ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/onlyonebranch.png?raw=true) You can also see from our [Commit History](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/commits/main) that we only push to the main branch. The screenshot below shows that we have connected our github repository to the pipeline so that whenever main is pushed to, the pipeline is run. ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/ci2.png?raw=true) The first thing it does after code is pushed to main is run the unit tests as outlined in the [app.json](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/blob/main/app.json) file. If those tests fail, the pipeline does not proceed, if they all pass, the pipeline proceeds. Screenshots of the tests in the pipeline are below.

  Successful Test![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/ci1.png?raw=true)

  Failed Test![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/ciFail1.png?raw=true)

  After the tests pass, the pipeline continues to build and then deploy the application to the correct environments. Below is a screenshot of the qa environment being built(and then deployed) after successful tests ran.![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/cibuild.png?raw=true)

- **Continuous Delivery**:
  We also use Heroku's pipeline feature to implement the CD portion of our pipeline. A visual of the Pipeline steps is below. The first stage builds ands deploys to our QA environment, on successful deployment of the QA environment, our production environment is built and deployed to. Finally, after production is successfully deployed to, our production tests are ran to test it is up and running.![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/cd1.png?raw=true) If any of these steps fail, the pipeline stops and does not proceed to further steps.
  Below is a screenshot of the build failing but the website still running to show that a failed build does not introduce a broken website. ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/failedbuildstillrunning.png?raw=true)
  Here is a screenshot of the logs of the project being successfuly built and then deployed. ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/cd2.png?raw=true) After the application is successfully deployed, the final stage runs tests against the production environment that are outlined in [buildpack-run.sh](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/blob/main/buildpack-run.sh). The tests test two things, one that the website is up and returns a response, and that the website returns expected results in the payloag. Below is a screenshot showing a successful post deploy test ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/cd3.png?raw=true) And here is a screenshot showing the post deploy tests fail ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/cdpostfail.png?raw=true)

- **Sprint Retro Actions:**
  - Retro Proof: Conducted on 11/29![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint2/retro.png?raw=true)
  - Change From Retro: We need to start meeting earlier in the sprint to get a plan laid out earlier so we can begin developing earlier. This has caused us to have to cram functionality in later in the sprint. Our plan/solution is that we have scheduled our Sprint Planning for the next sprint to be the very first day of the sprint and all team members will be present for it.

-**Other**: Because we have integrated a CI/CD Pipeline into our development process we decided to modify our Definition of Done as follows:

- All related backlog items to user story are done
- Product owner approval
- Acceptance criteria met for each story
- New unit tests passed
- No bugs introduced, all prior tests still pass
- NEW: When code is committed, CI/CD pipeline successfully runs and deploys the new code
- NEW: Production environment has new changes deployed

# Part 4

- **Note**: All User Stories are expressed as user stories if you click into the details of a PBI. The titles of the PBIs are shorter on the backlog for brevities sake.

- **Forecasted Points**: 120 Points Per Sprint
- **Rationale**: Last sprint we completed 120 points in a decently comfortable amount of time so we decided that would be our new forecast. While doing sprint planning for this sprint we pulled 110 points into our current sprint. The next story from the backlog would have put us over our forecasted points so we only have 110 points of planned stories this sprint.
- **Stories pulled into backlog**: Our backlog is ordered in terms of what needs to get done first, we, the developers, pulled the maximum stories into our sprint from the top of the backlog that did not exceed our forecasted points.

- All stories are less than half of our current forecast. (Max of 40)
- User stories were decomposed into tasks, in our Miro board, red items are tasks, and blue items are user stories as outlined by the key.

- **Kanban board link**: [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lnCeYTY=/?invite_link_id=692868496345) The board is split into Sprint 1, Sprint 2, and Sprint 3 which are clearly labeled.

- **Impediment Removal Plan**: Swarm the impediment as a team to come up with a solution or workaround to unblock the impediment. Example Impediments from this sprint:

  - There was a technical impediment around emailing the certificate of insurance to a user after purchasing insurance, the workaround we came up with was to embed certificate into the site and allow the user to download the certificate themselves
  - There was an AWS outage that broke our CI/CD pipelines so we couldn't deliver new feature to our site. Our solution was to keep developing locally and pushing to our main branch. Based on our experience we expected the outage to be fixed in a day, then we would kick off the pipeline manually for this one instance. (This worked)

- **Sprint board update and Burndown Updates**: Screenshots of burndown updates are above.

- **Tests**: The unit tests are in the python_logic\test_quote.py file. [File here](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/blob/main/python_logic/test_quote.py). There are 41 unit tests, up from 26 last sprint. There is also one Cucumber Gherkin BDD test located [here](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/blob/main/GetQuote.feature), the steps of said BDD test are [here](https://github.com/mrtyson93/insurancemasters/blob/main/steps/GetQuote.py) Below is a screenshot of the 41 unit tests and 1 BDD test running in our ci/cd pipeline. ![Alt text](/ProjectManagement/Sprint3/testscicd.png?raw=true)

- **Sprint Retro Actions:**
  - Retro Proof: TBD

-**Other**: Because we have also added BDD into our CI/CD Pipeline we process we modified our Definition of Done as follows:

- All related backlog items to user story are done
- Product owner approval
- Acceptance criteria met for each story
- New unit tests passed
- No bugs introduced, all prior tests still pass
- When code is committed, CI/CD pipeline successfully runs and deploys the new code
- Production environment has new changes deployed
- NEW: BDD Tests written and passed
