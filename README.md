# Part 2

- **Forecasted Points**: 100 Points Per Sprint
- **Rationale**: There are 270 total points of User Stories planned in our backlog which are planned to complete throughout the semester. There are three sprints so we divided by three and rounded up to an even 100. This will allow us to plan all of the user stories throughout the next three sprints.

- **Stories pulled into backlog**: Our backlog is ordered in terms of what needs to get done first, we, the developers, pulled the maximum stories into our sprint from the top of the backlog that did not exceed our forecasted points.

- All stories are less than half of our current forecast.
- User stories were decomposed into tasks, in our Miro board, red items are tasks, and blue items are user stories as outlined by the key.
