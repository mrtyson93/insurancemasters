# How to run the Flask application?

When you have your conda environment setup (see settings folder), you can run your first Flask app using the following command.
```bash
$ flask run
```

This is what you would get if everything is okay.
```bash
 * Serving Flask app 'app.py' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5010/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 125-766-485
```
Then you can open the browser and paste the URL above http://127.0.0.1:5010/
